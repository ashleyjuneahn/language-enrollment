# Analysis of Modern Language Association dataset

## Project Abstract

Two years ago, Parasite became the first film in a foreign language to win best picture at the Oscars. Squid Game then became Netflix's most-watched show of all time, winning a historic six Emmys in September. With the increasing prevelance of Korean popular culture, I was interested to see if college student enrollment in Korean language classes had increased in the past decade. Using [Modern Language Association's dataset](https://apps.mla.org/flsurvey_search) on language enrollments in United States institutions of higher education from 1958 to 2016, I used the Google Colab environment in Python to analyze the dataset.

Enrollment in Korean language classes has risen 78% from 2009 to 2016, reaching 15,000, while total enrollment in language classes has plateaued in recent years. The only other widely learned language with significant growth in the span was American Sign Language, which increased enrollments by 37%. The percent of students learning a language who are enrolled in Korean also jumped from 0.5% to 0.9% from 2009 to 2016. Experts attribute the rise in Korean language enrollment to K-pop.

Ten years ago, Psy's "Gangnam Style" became the most viewed video on YouTube of its time, marking K-pop's first splash on the global music stage. In 2018, BTS became the first K-pop act to hit No.1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and BLACKPINK became the first K-pop girl group to perform at Coachella a year later.

Contrary to the strict upward trend of Korean language enrollment, the dataset shows the first decrease in enrollment for Japanese language in the 21st century from 2009 to 2013. Chinese langauge enrollment also witnessed its first drop since 2000 from 2013 to 2016. Victor Cha, who is the Senior Vice President for Asia and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told NPR the drop in Chinese language enrollment has likely to do with harshening relations between the U.S. and China. 

## Conclusion

Young people's infatuation with Korean popular culture is an opportunity for South Korea to engage different sectors of Americans and make them supporters of the country across various industries, experts say. South Korea has emerged as a global leader in industries including electric vehicles, semiconductor chips and global health. The increasing interest in Korean popular culture among young people will naturally bring them into the fold of Korean businesses and U.S.-Korea relations that hopefully will lead to life-long friendships with South Korea.
